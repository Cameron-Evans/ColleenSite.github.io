    <hr> style="color: white;"> Nameless Horrible is an original Celtic folkhorror comic about grief and belief, by Lee Marie.
Each issue is binded by hand and thread and includes other special details added by the creator.  </h3>
    <h2> In May Lee was able to travel to Ireland, where NH is based, to further her research around the countries transition from Celtic Paganism to Christianity.    </h2>
    <h2> In June, Lee participated in an artist residency at the Lookoutartsquarry in which she worked on further developing her series.</h2>
    <h2> The second issue of Nameless Horrible incorporates photos from Lee's trip to Ireland and her time at the quarry in the form of 'photobashing'. </h2>
    <h2> Photobashing is a technique in which artists merge and blend photographs with painterly techniques to create new artwork.</h2>
